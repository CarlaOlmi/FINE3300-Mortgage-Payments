# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
Program that calculates the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, weekly, and rapid weekly amounts. With a principal of $500 000, rate of 5.5% and amortization of 25 I used the annuity formula to find the results of the different mortgage.
I have calculated mortgage payments based on different payment frequencies and used the Present Value of Annuity (PVA) formula to determine the payments.
Adjusted the rate depends on the period
And run
